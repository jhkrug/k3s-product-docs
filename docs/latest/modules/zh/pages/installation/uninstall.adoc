[CAUTION]
====
Uninstalling K3s may cause data loss!
====

If you installed K3s using the installation script, a script to uninstall K3s was generated during installation.

Running the uninstall script stops K3s and all running pods, and deletes the local cluster datastore, xref:storage.adoc#_setting_up_the_local_storage_provider[Local Storage] Persistent Volume data, node configuration, and all of the scripts and CLI tools.

It does not remove any data from external datastores, or created by pods using external Kubernetes Persistent Volumes.

If you are planning on rejoining a node to an existing cluster after uninstalling and reinstalling, be sure to delete the node from the cluster to ensure that the node password secret is removed. See the xref:architecture.adoc#_how_agent_node_registration_works[Node Registration] documentation for more information.
